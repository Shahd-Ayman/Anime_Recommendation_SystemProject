# Anime_Recommendation_SystemProject
There were many people wondering how to find the best Animes based on their favorite Animes, and they weren't sure where to find.  That's basically the motivation for this project because,this project helps in creating a system that produces efficient data based on the user viewing history and sharing rating.
We use Anime Recommendation database which shared in [[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database)]
##### We apply the Naïve bayes classifier on our dataset.

##### •Kaggle
##### •Python
##### •Rapid Miner
## The Python libraries used for this project are:
```

### We also use boxplot to find the outliers
